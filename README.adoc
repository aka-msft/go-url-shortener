== Deployment on OpenShift

run the following commands:

```
# deploy the database secrets (credentials)
oc apply -f templates/database-secrets.yml
# deploy the database (postgres 10)
oc apply -f templates/database-deployment.openshift.yml
# deploy the internal service
oc apply -f templates/database-service.yml

# create the web app config 
oc apply -f templates/webapp-config.yaml
# create a deployment config for the web app
oc apply -f templates/webapp-deploymentconfig.yml
# expose the webapp as a node service
oc apply -f templates/webapp-service.yml

# rollout the latest version of the webapp (if an image already exists in the container registry)
oc rollout latest deploymentconfigs/webapp

```

Once the deployment config is in place, just deploy a new version of the webapp with `make minishift-image && make push-minishift`

== TODO 

- see howe to run the tests during the build
- see how to PVC support for the storage, which fail for now with the following error (when running with the `developer` account):
```
> oc apply -f templates/database-storage.yml
persistentvolumeclaim "postgres-pv-claim" unchanged
Error from server (Forbidden): error when retrieving current configuration of:
